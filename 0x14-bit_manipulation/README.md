# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

## Overview

This project explores the topic of bit manipulation in the C programming language. Bit manipulation involves performing operations on individual bits within a binary representation of data.

## Bitwise Operators

C provides several bitwise operators for working with individual bits in integers. These operators include:

- `&` (Bitwise AND)
- `|` (Bitwise OR)
- `^` (Bitwise XOR)
- `~` (Bitwise NOT)
- `<<` (Left Shift)
- `>>` (Right Shift)

Understanding how these operators work and when to use them is crucial for effective bit manipulation.

## Task Descriptions

This project consists of several tasks, each focused on different aspects of bit manipulation. The tasks include:

- A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
- A function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- A function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
- A function that checks the endianness.
- Find the password for this program.


Each task will require you to implement C functions that achieve the desired bit manipulation.

## Usage

To compile and run the programs for each task, follow these general steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x14-bit-manipulation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd 0x14-bit-manipulation

3. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc):

   ```shell
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 task1-main.c task1.c -o task1

4. Run the executable:

   ```shell
   ./task1

4. Repeat the compilation and execution steps for each task, modifying the source files and executable names accordingly.
